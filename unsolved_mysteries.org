* Unsolved mysteries
Here I collect rust snippets which I absolutely not understand at the moment.
Eventually they will move oder to idiomatics.org. I hope.

** formatter definition
fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", hex::encode(&self.0))
    }

** impl
** self and Self
** data.0
could be anything instead of data. I guess it's accessing struct elements or similar by numerical index.
